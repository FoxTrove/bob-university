# Bob University - Marketing & Launch Plan

**Based on**: Marketing Strategy Workshop (January 2026)
**Target Launch**: February 20, 2026 (29 days from now)
**Webinar Date**: February 27, 2026 (1 week post-launch)
**Current App Readiness**: 75-80% (see LAUNCH_AUDIT.md)

---

## Strategy Overview

The launch follows a **two-campaign approach** with a **soft launch phase** for risk mitigation:

| Campaign | Goal | Target Audience |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| **Soft Launch** | Test with real users, fix issues | 50-100 beta testers |
| **App Launch** | Drive downloads, re-engage lapsed users | Existing email list, previous subscribers |
| **Lead Generation (Webinar)** | Build new email list, convert to subscribers | New stylists via social media |

The webinar ("Grand Slam Offer") is designed as a **high-trust, high-value free offer** that solves a surface-level problem (content creation anxiety) to expose the deeper problem (skill gaps) that the app solves.

### Core Strategy Pillars

1. **Expert-Led Positioning** — Ray as professional authority, not just influencer
2. **SMS + Email Marketing** — Dual-channel for 8x better engagement
3. **Soft Launch De-risking** — Two beta rounds before public launch
4. **Optimized Webinar Funnel** — Research-backed conversion targets
5. **Micro-Influencer Partnerships** — Authentic voices in the stylist community
6. **Referral Program** (Post-Launch) — Viral growth loop for Month 2+

---

## Soft Launch Strategy (Jan 29 - Feb 11)

A phased soft launch reduces risk and provides real-world data before the public launch.

### Phase 1: Internal Beta (Jan 29 - Feb 4)

**Audience**: Team + 20 trusted stylists (hand-picked)

| What to Test | Success Criteria |
|--------------|------------------|
| Onboarding flow | 90%+ completion |
| Video playback | No buffering/crashes |
| Community posting | Posts appear correctly |
| Payment flow (Stripe) | Successful test purchase |
| Payment flow (Apple IAP) | Successful sandbox purchase |

**Feedback Collection**:
- Daily check-in Slack/group chat
- Simple feedback form (3 questions max)
- Screen recordings of any bugs

**Iteration Window**: Feb 3-4 for critical fixes

### Phase 2: Expanded Beta (Feb 5 - Feb 11)

**Audience**: 50-100 users from email list (opt-in invite)

**Invite Email Subject**: "You're invited: Early access to Bob University app"

| What to Measure | Target |
|-----------------|--------|
| Day 1 retention | 60%+ |
| Day 3 retention | 45%+ |
| Day 7 retention | 35%+ |
| Videos started | 3+ per user |
| Community posts | 10+ total |
| Crash rate | <1% |

**Beta Perks** (to incentivize participation):
- Free month of premium after launch
- "Founding Member" badge in community
- Direct line to Ray for feedback

**Go/No-Go Decision**: Feb 11
- If metrics hit targets → Proceed to launch
- If critical issues → Fix and extend beta 3-5 days

---

## Expert-Led Positioning

**2026 Trend**: Consumers are gravitating toward professional authority and expert-founded brands over generic influencer content.

### Messaging Framework

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Hair tutorials" | "Professional techniques from a working stylist" |
| "Learn to cut hair" | "Master the skills top salons use" |
| "Online course" | "Career-building education with certification" |
| "Watch videos" | "Train with Ray — 15+ years behind the chair" |

### Key Proof Points to Emphasize

- Ray's years of experience and current client roster
- Certification program (professional credential)
- Real results: stylists who've grown their books
- "Not just an influencer — a working professional"

### Content Angles

- "Learn from someone who still cuts hair every day"
- "The techniques I use on my actual clients"
- "Education that builds careers, not just followers"
- "What I wish I knew when I started"

---

## SMS Marketing Channel

SMS dramatically outperforms email for time-sensitive communications.

### Why SMS?

| Metric | SMS | Email |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Open Rate | 98% | 39% |
| Click-Through Rate | 19-35% | 0.77-4.36% |
| Conversion Rate | 21-30% | 12% |
| Response Rate | 45% | 6-10% |

### Implementation

**Opt-In Points**:
- Webinar registration (checkbox: "Send me SMS reminders")
- App onboarding (optional phone number field)
- Beta tester sign-up

**SMS Use Cases**:

| Trigger | Message Example | Timing |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Webinar registered | "You're in! We'll text you before the live training." | Immediate |
| Webinar reminder | "Starting in 1 hour! Join here: [link]" | 1 hour before |
| App launch | "It's live! Download Bob University: [link]" | Launch day |
| Abandoned signup | "Still thinking about it? Questions?" | 24 hours |

**Tool**: GHL has built-in SMS. Ensure compliance with opt-in/opt-out.

---

## Campaign 1: App Launch

### Target Audience
- Existing email list (~20+ lapsed subscribers)
- Previous platform users (GoHighLevel)
- Current social media followers

### Messaging
> "Thanks for being part of our community. We've built something new - the Bob University app. Download now to access [X free videos], the community, and your learning journey."

### Assets Needed

| Asset | Owner | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Launch announcement email | Marketing | Not started | |
| App Store listing (iOS) | Kyle | In progress | Screenshots, description |
| Google Play listing | Kyle | In progress | |
| Promo video for social | Ray | Not started | 30-60 second announcement |
| Instagram Stories (3-5) | Ray | Not started | Countdown, sneak peeks |
| Email sequence (3-5 emails) | Marketing | Not started | See sequence below |

### Email + SMS Sequence

| Day | Email | SMS (opted-in) |

| -3 (Feb 17) | Countdown: "3 days until launch" | — |
| -1 (Feb 19) | Final reminder: "Tomorrow!" | "Bob University launches tomorrow! 🚀" |
| 0 (Feb 20) | **Launch**: "The app is here" + links | "It's live! Download now: [link]" |
| +2 | Value reminder: Community feature | — |
| +5 | Social proof: Beta user testimonials | — |
| +7 | Webinar invite: "Free training Thursday" | "Free live training this week: [link]" |
| +10 | Last call: "Haven't downloaded?" | — |

### Reactivation Strategy for Lapsed Users
- Sunset GoHighLevel platform entirely (only ~20 users)
- Send personalized email: "Your learning continues here"
- Don't call out inactivity - focus on "new and improved"
- Require new payment info in app (fresh start)

---

## Campaign 2: Lead Generation Webinar

### The Grand Slam Offer
**Title**: "How to Create Content That Fills Your Books" (working title)

**Promise**: Free live webinar teaching Ray's exact system for:
- Baby-stepping into content creation
- Creating simple content without video editing skills
- Understanding the algorithm (what gets pushed to potential clients)
- Building a waitlist of clients through social media

**Format**: Live Instagram/video stream → recorded as evergreen asset

### Target Pain Points Addressed

From the Three C's framework:
| Pain Point | Webinar Solves | App Solves (Upsell) |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| "I don't know how to create content" | Yes - main topic | Ongoing community support |
| "I'm scared to put myself out there" | Yes - baby steps approach | Safe space to practice |
| "My skills aren't good enough to show" | Exposed as next problem | Video education |
| "I don't have full books" | Content → clients pipeline | Skills → clients → revenue |

### Optimized Webinar Funnel

### Target Influencer Profile

- Hair stylists/barbers with 5K-50K followers
- High engagement rate (>3%)
- Creates educational or behind-the-scenes content
- Not directly competing (no own course/app)
- Aligns with Ray's vibe and values

### Partnership Tiers

| Tier | Followers | What They Get | What You Get |
|------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Nano** | 1K-5K | Free 6-month premium | Local awareness, testimonials |
| **Micro** | 5K-25K | Free year + 20% affiliate | Niche credibility, steady referrals |
| **Mid** | 25K-100K | Paid collab + affiliate | Broad awareness, launch boost |

### Affiliate Structure

- **Payouts**: Monthly via PayPal/Venmo
- **Dashboard**: Share conversion stats with partners

### Content Ideas for Partners

- "Day in my life using Bob University"
- "I tried this technique from the app" transformation
- "Roast My Video" participation (community feature)
- Webinar co-host or Q&A guest appearance
- Honest review/walkthrough of app

### Outreach Plan (Week 2-3)

1. **Identify 10-15 candidates** — check engagement, content quality
2. **Warm up** — like/comment on their posts for a few days
3. **DM outreach** — personalized message, not templated
4. **Offer value first** — free access, no strings attached
5. **Follow up** — if interested, send affiliate details

**Sample DM**:
> Hey [Name]! Love your content, especially [specific post]. I'm working with Ray from Bob University — we're launching an app for stylists and I think your audience would really dig it. Would you be open to trying it free and sharing if you like it? No pressure either way. Let me know!

### Launch Week Coordination

- 3-5 influencers post about the app on launch day (Feb 20)
- Coordinate timing for maximum impact
- Provide them with assets (screenshots, talking points)
- Share their posts to Bob University's stories

---

## Referral Program (Post-Launch: March)

A dual-sided referral program creates a viral growth loop and reduces CAC.

### Structure

| Who | Reward |
|-----|--------|
| **Referrer** (existing user) | 1 free month of premium |
| **Referee** (new user) | 20% off first month |

### User Flow

1. User completes a module or earns badge → prompt: "Share your achievement?"
2. User taps "Share" → generates unique referral link
3. Friend clicks link → downloads app → signs up
4. Friend subscribes → both get rewards automatically
5. Referrer notified: "You earned a free month!"

### Implementation Requirements

**Database** (already in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md):
```sql
CREATE TABLE referral_codes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  uses INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  reward_months INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  referee_discount_percent INTEGER DEFAULT 20,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE referral_redemptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  code_id UUID REFERENCES referral_codes(id),
  referee_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  referrer_rewarded BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

**App Changes**:
- Share button on achievement/completion screens
- Referral code input during signup
- "My Referrals" section in profile

**Tracking**:
- Viral coefficient (K-factor): aim for >0.3
- Referrals per user
- Conversion rate of referred users

### Launch Timeline

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| Mar 1-7 | Build referral UI + database |
| Mar 8-14 | Test with beta users |
| Mar 15 | Launch to all users |

### Launch Sequence

#### Email 1: Teaser (Feb 13) — "Something big coming"

**Subject**: I've been keeping a secret
**Preview**: And I'm finally ready to tell you

```
Hey [First Name],

For the past year, I've been working on something behind the scenes.

Something I wish existed when I was starting out.

Something that would have saved me YEARS of figuring things out the hard way.

On February 20th, I'm launching the Bob University app.

Here's what it is:
- Video lessons on real techniques (not theory)
- A community of stylists supporting each other
- Certification to prove you've done the work

Here's what it's NOT:
- Another $500 course that collects dust
- Generic content made by people who don't cut hair
- Fluff without substance

It's free to download. The community is free. And the premium education is there when you're ready.

Mark your calendar: February 20th.

I'll be sharing more this week.

– Ray

P.S. If you want early access, just reply "early" and I'll add you to the beta list.
